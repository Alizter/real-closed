# Theorems for real closed fields
The repository contains
- a
  [certified quantifier elimination for the theory of real closed field](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00593738v4)
- a [construction of real closure of an archimedean field](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00671809v2)
- a construction of the algebraic closure of a real closed field

Except for the end-results listed above, one should not rely on anything.

The formalization is based on the [Mathematical Components](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp)
library for the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) proof assistant.

## Installation
